  ```

- **prd-to-issues** — Break a PRD into independently-grabbable GitHub issues using vertical slices.

  ```

- **tenth-man** — Evaluate a technical decision through several forced perspectives and a contrarian review before synthesizing the trade-offs.

## Efficiency & Simplification

- **caveman** — A terse, technically accurate communication mode with configurable compression levels.

- **ponytail** — A minimal-solution development mode that prioritizes YAGNI, standard libraries, and native platform features.

- **ponytail-review** — Review a diff exclusively for unnecessary complexity and simplification opportunities.

- **ponytail-audit** — Perform a whole-repository audit for bloat, dead flexibility, and avoidable dependencies.

- **ponytail-debt** — Collect `ponytail:` shortcut markers into a debt ledger.
